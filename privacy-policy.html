                  authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a
                  third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails,
                  because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your

                  people who have opted-in to receive communications from us.
                  Email addresses submitted only through the order processing
                  page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you
                  information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however,

                <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
                <p>
                  We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide
                  CrypWave to you and fulfill the purposes described in this
                  policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your
                  information with and who carries out services on our behalf.
                  When we no longer need to use your information and there is no
                  need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory
                  obligations, weâll either remove it from our systems or
                  depersonalize it so that we can’t identify you.
                </p>
                <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
                <p>
                  We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the
                  safety of your personal information when you place an order or
                  enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer
                  the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit
                  information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                  technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway
                  providers database only to be accessible by those authorized
                  with special access rights to such systems, and are required
                  to keep the information confidential. After a transaction,
                  your private information (credit cards, social security
                  numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot,
                  however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any
                  information you transmit to CrypWave or guarantee that your
                  information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed,
                  altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical,
                  technical, or managerial safeguards.

                <h3>Could My Information Be Transferred To Other Countries?</h3>
                <p>
                  CrypWave is incorporated in Lithuania. Information collected
                  via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from
                  use of our help services may be transferred from time to time
                  to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located
                  throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in
                  the world, including countries that may not have laws of
                  general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such
                  data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by
                  using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the
                  trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
                </p>

                  Is The Information Collected Through The CrypWave Service
                  Secure?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We take precautions to protect the security of your
                  information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial
                  procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access,
                  maintain data security, and correctly use your information.
                  However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof,
                  including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit
                  intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies.
                  Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your
                  personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                  security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty
                  to protect your personal information, you agree that
                  intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure
                  our compliance with that duty.

                  (subject to the following paragraph), byÂ cancelling your

                  remove each and every record of the information you have
                  provided to us from our system. The need to back up our
                  systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means

                  serving ads across the internet to people who have already
                  visited your website. It allows your company to seem like
                  they’re âfollowingâ people around the internet by serving ads
                  on the websites and platforms they use most.

                  Information About General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We may be collecting and using information from you if you are
                  from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of
                  our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why
                  is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under
                  protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
                </p>
                <h3>What Is GDPR?</h3>
                <p>
                  GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that
                  regulates how EU residents’ data is protected by companies and
                  enhances the controlÂ the EU residents have, over their
                  personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not
                  just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customersâ
                  data is important irrespective of where they are located,
                  which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline
                  standard for all our operations worldwide.
                </p>
                <h3>What Is Personal Data?</h3>
                <p>
                  Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified
                  individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
                  could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces
                  of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends
                  beyond a personâs name or email address. Some examples include
                  financial information, political opinions, genetic data,
                  biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
                  orientation, and ethnicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal,
                    and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a
                    person would reasonably expect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific
                    purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.
                    Organizations must specify why they need the personal data
                    when they collect it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to
                    fulfil its purpose.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their
                    own personal data. They can also request a copy of their
                    data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted,
                    or moved to another organization.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Is GDPR Important?</h3>
                <p>
                  GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should
                  protect individuals’ personal data that they collect and
                  process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by
                  increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach.
                  Beyond these facts it’s simply the right thing to do. At
                  CrypWave we strongly believe that your data privacy is very
                  important and we already have solid security and privacy
                  practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new
                  regulation.
                </p>
