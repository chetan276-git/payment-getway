                  We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us,
                  such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the website, database storage and management, e-mail
                  management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for
                  products and services you may purchase through the website. We will likely share your personal
                  information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to
                  perform these services for us and for you.

                  parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is
                  shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed,
                  whether you have visited the website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the
                  website. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the website and then
                  provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers. We may also disclose personal and
                  non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as
                  we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal
                  process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the
                  safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable
                  activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.

                <h3>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h3>

                  By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel
                  your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other
                  unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have
                  authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited
                  commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also
                  agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook,
                  where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications

                  purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have
                  provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in
                  this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we

                <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
                <p>
                  We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide CrypWave to you and fulfill the
                  purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information
                  with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and
                  there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either
                  remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can’t identify you.
                </p>
                <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
                <p>
                  We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when
                  you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure
                  server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                  technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by
                  those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
                  confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers,
                  financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security
                  of any information you transmit to CrypWave or guarantee that your information on the Service may not
                  be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or
                  managerial safeguards.
                </p>
                <h3>Could My Information Be Transferred To Other Countries?</h3>
                <p>
                  CrypWave is incorporated in Lithuania. Information collected via our website, through direct
                  interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our
                  offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted
                  anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating
                  the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of
                  the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
                </p>
                <h3>Is The Information Collected Through The CrypWave Service Secure?</h3>
                <p>
                  We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and
                  managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
                  correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including
                  encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow
                  policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your
                  personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our
                  compliance with that duty.
                </p>
                <h3>Can I Update Or Correct My Information?</h3>
                <p>
                  The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information CrypWave collects depend on
                  your relationship with CrypWave. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our
                  internal company employment policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally
                  identifiable information as follows. You canÂ contact us in order to (1) update or correct your
                  personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and
                  other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information
                  maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), byÂ cancelling your account.
                  Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we
                  maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy
                  prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may
                  take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting
                  you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
                  unique password and account information at all times.

                  You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the
                  information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect
                  information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable
                  form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all
                  personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be
                  updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and
                  technically practicable.

                  the information we have relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no
                  effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in
                  accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.

                    <br />Local Storage sometimes known as DOM storage, provides web apps with methods and protocols for
                    storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with
                    a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header.

                <h3>Information About General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
                <p>
                  We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA),
                  and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
                  collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong
                  way.
                </p>
                <h3>What Is GDPR?</h3>
                <p>
                  GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents’ data is protected
                  by companies and enhances the controlÂ the EU residents have, over their personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU
                  residents. Our customers' data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we
                  have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
                </p>
                <h3>What Is Personal Data?</h3>
                <p>
                  Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of
                  information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to
                  identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples
                  include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses,
                  physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
                </p>
                <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be
                    used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for
                    that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
                  </li>
                  <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
                  <li>
                    People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a
                    copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another
                    organization.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Is GDPR Important?</h3>
                <p>
                  GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals’ personal data that
                  they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and
                  imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it’s simply the right thing to do. At CrypWave
                  we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and
                  privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
                </p>
                <h3>Individual Data Subject’s Rights – Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h3>
                <p>
                  We are committed to helping our customers meet theÂ data subject rights requirements of GDPR. CrypWave
                  processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all
                  conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we
                  dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold
                  it longer than 60 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the
                  ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We’ve been set up as self
                  service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our
                  customerÂ support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the
                  API.
